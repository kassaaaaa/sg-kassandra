### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: The `asA`, `iWant`, and `soThat` fields are clearly captured within the `<story>` element.

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: The acceptance criteria are listed clearly with IDs and titles, and appear to be well-defined, directly reflecting functional requirements without inventing new scope.

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: Tasks are clearly broken down with subtasks and references to acceptance criteria.

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: There are 8 document artifacts included, each with a path, title, section, and a relevant snippet. This falls within the 5-15 range and provides good context.

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: There are 5 code artifacts included, each with a path, kind, symbol, lines (where applicable), and a clear reason for inclusion.

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: Key interfaces like the `instructor_details` table, `AuthService`, and Supabase Client are identified with their kind, signature, and path.

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: A comprehensive list of constraints is provided, covering data schema, security, UI components, service layer, route protection, dependencies, and form validation, reflecting applicable development rules and patterns.

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: Both Node.js package dependencies (for root and app) and key frameworks (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod) are clearly listed with versions where applicable.

✓ Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: Testing standards are clearly described, including the tools (Playwright, Vitest) and their configurations. Specific test locations are provided, along with test ideas linked to acceptance criteria.

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: The overall structure of the XML document, with top-level elements like `<story-context>`, `<metadata>`, `<story>`, `<acceptanceCriteria>`, `<artifacts>`, `<dependencies>`, `<constraints>`, `<interfaces>`, and `<tests>`, directly matches the expected structure for a story context XML.
