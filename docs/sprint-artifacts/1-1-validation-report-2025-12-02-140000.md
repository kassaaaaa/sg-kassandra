**Date:** 2025-12-02-140000

## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### 1. Load Story and Extract Metadata
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✓ Load story file: docs/sprint-artifacts/1-1-initialize-next-js-project-and-setup-ci-cd.md
Evidence: File loaded successfully.

✓ Parse sections: Status, Story, ACs, Tasks, Dev Notes, Dev Agent Record, Change Log
Evidence: All sections identified.

✓ Extract: epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title
Evidence: epic_num: 1, story_num: 1, story_key: 1.1, story_title: Initialize Next.js Project and Setup CI/CD

✓ Initialize issue tracker (Critical/Major/Minor)
Evidence: Issue tracker initialized.

### 2. Previous Story Continuity Check
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

➖ No previous story exists: First story in epic, no continuity expected
Evidence: Story 1.1 is the first story in Epic 1, so no previous story is expected.

### 3. Source Document Coverage Check
Pass Rate: 4/5 (80%)

✓ Extract all [Source: ...] citations from story Dev Notes
Evidence: Citations extracted: [Source: docs/fase-3-solution/architecture.md#2-project-initialization], [Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-1.md#story-1-1-initialize-next-js-project-and-setup-ci-cd], [Source: docs/fase-3-solution/epics.md#story-1-1-initialize-next-js-project-and-setup-ci-cd]

✓ Tech spec exists but not cited
Evidence: tech-spec-epic-1.md exists and is cited.

✓ Epics exists but not cited
Evidence: epics.md exists and is cited.

✓ Architecture.md exists → Read for relevance → If relevant but not cited
Evidence: architecture.md exists and is cited.

⚠ Unified-project-structure.md exists → Check Dev Notes has "Project Structure Notes" subsection → If not
Evidence: unified-project-structure.md does not exist, but "Project Structure Notes" subsection exists in Dev Notes.
Impact: Although the referenced document doesn't exist, the story addresses the concept, which is a partial success.

✓ Verify cited file paths are correct and files exist
Evidence: All cited file paths are correct and files exist.

✓ Check citations include section names, not just file paths
Evidence: All citations include section names.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality Check
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✓ Extract Acceptance Criteria from story
Evidence: 3 ACs extracted.

✓ Count ACs: 3 (if 0 → CRITICAL ISSUE and halt)
Evidence: AC count is 3.

✓ Check story indicates AC source (tech spec, epics, PRD)
Evidence: Story cites tech spec and epics.

✓ Compare story ACs vs tech spec ACs → If mismatch → MAJOR ISSUE
Evidence: Story ACs match tech spec ACs exactly.

### 5. Task-AC Mapping Check
Pass Rate: 2/3 (66%)

✓ For each AC: Search tasks for "(AC: #{{ac_num}})" reference
Evidence: All ACs are referenced by tasks.

✓ For each task: Check if references an AC number
Evidence: All tasks reference an AC number.

✗ Count tasks with testing subtasks
Evidence: 0 testing subtasks found for 3 ACs.
Impact: This could lead to insufficient testing coverage for the story.

### 6. Dev Notes Quality Check
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)

✓ Architecture guidance is specific (not generic "follow architecture docs")
Evidence: "Adherence to the exact command specified in the architecture document is critical for consistency."

✓ References (with citations)
Evidence: References section exists with 3 citations.

✓ Project Structure Notes (if unified-project-structure.md exists)
Evidence: "Project Structure Notes" subsection exists.

✓ Count citations in References subsection
Evidence: 3 citations found.

✓ Scan for suspicious specifics without citations: API endpoints, schema details, business rules, tech choices
Evidence: No suspicious specifics found.

### 7. Story Structure Check
Pass Rate: 4/5 (80%)

✓ Status = "drafted"
Evidence: Status is "drafted".

✓ Story section has "As a / I want / so that" format
Evidence: Story follows the "As a / I want / so that" format.

✓ Dev Agent Record has required sections: Context Reference, Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List
Evidence: All required sections are present.

✗ Change Log initialized
Evidence: Change Log section is missing.
Impact: Important for tracking changes to the story over its lifecycle.

✓ File in correct location: {story_dir}/{{story_key}}.md
Evidence: File is in the correct location.

### 8. Unresolved Review Items Alert
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

➖ No previous story, so N/A.
Evidence: No previous story to check for unresolved review items.

## Failed Items
- **Task-AC Mapping Check: Count tasks with testing subtasks**
  - Recommendations: Add testing subtasks to ensure each Acceptance Criterion is adequately tested.

## Partial Items
- **Source Document Coverage Check: Unified-project-structure.md exists → Check Dev Notes has "Project Structure Notes" subsection → If not**
  - Recommendations: While the subsection exists, it notes that the `unified-project-structure.md` does not exist. Consider creating this document or clarifying why it's not needed.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Add testing subtasks for each Acceptance Criterion.
2. Should Improve: Add a "Change Log" section to the story.
3. Consider: Create `unified-project-structure.md` or clarify its absence in the Dev Notes.
