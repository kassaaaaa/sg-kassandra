    <asA>As a Developer,</asA>
    <iWant>I want to initialize the Next.js application and configure the basic CI/CD pipeline,</iWant>
    <soThat>so that we have a consistent and automated foundation for development and deployment.</soThat>
    <tasks>
      - [ ] Task 1 (AC: #1)
        - [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint`.
        - [ ] **Test:** Write a `Vitest` unit test to check that `package.json` contains `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, and `eslint` as dependencies.
        - [ ] **Test:** Write a `Vitest` unit test to verify that `tailwind.config.ts` and `.eslintrc.json` files exist at the root.
      - [ ] Task 2 (AC: #2)
        - [ ] Create a new project on Vercel.
        - [ ] Connect the Vercel project to the project's git repository.
        - [ ] **Test (Manual):** Confirm that the Vercel project dashboard shows the repository as connected.
      - [ ] Task 3 (AC: #3)
        - [ ] Configure the Vercel project to run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` on each deployment.
        - [ ] Ensure the main branch is automatically deployed to production.
        - [ ] **Test:** After a push to a PR, inspect the Vercel deployment logs to confirm that the `lint` and `test` commands were executed.
        - [ ] **Test (E2E):** Write a basic `Playwright` test that navigates to the deployed Vercel URL and verifies the presence of a key element (e.g., the Next.js welcome page `<h1>`). The CI should run this test post-deployment.

  <acceptanceCriteria>
    1. The root directory is initialized as a Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint configured.
    2. The project is connected to a Vercel account for automated deployments.
    3. A basic CI pipeline is configured to run linting and tests on every push to the main branch.
