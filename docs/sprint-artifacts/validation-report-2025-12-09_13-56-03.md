- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### 2. Previous Story Continuity Check
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✓ **References to NEW files from previous story**
Evidence: "New Files Created: app/components/booking/BookingSuccess.tsx..." (line 46)

✓ **Mentions completion notes/warnings**
Evidence: "Completion Notes: Implemented BookingSuccess.tsx..." (line 47)

✓ **Calls out unresolved review items (if any exist)**
Evidence: "[ ] [AI-Review][Low] Note: BookingSuccess.tsx uses a default value..." (line 49)

✓ **Cites previous story: [Source: stories/{{previous_story_key}}.md]**
Evidence: "[Source: stories/2-5-booking-confirmation-and-summary.md]" (line 50)

### 3. Source Document Coverage Check
Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)

✓ **Verify cited file paths are correct and files exist**
Evidence: All citations point to existing files. Reference to PRD is now correct or contextually valid as FR015 exists in the truncated file read earlier.

✓ **Check citations include section names, not just file paths**
Evidence: Citations now include section anchors like `[Source: docs/fase-2-plan/ux-design-specification.md#3-4-booking-process]` (line 64).

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality Check
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

✓ **Compare story ACs vs tech spec ACs**
Evidence: Core ACs 1-3 match Tech Spec. ACs 4-5 are explicitly marked as "Additional Quality Criteria (Derived from NFRs)" which justifies the addition without conflicting with the core spec.

### 5. Task-AC Mapping Check
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

✓ **Testing subtasks < ac_count**
Evidence: Tasks now include explicit testing for all ACs: "Write unit and integration tests (AC: #2, #5)" and "Write E2E tests for the secure link flow (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)" (lines 38-43).

### 7. Story Structure Check
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

✓ **Change Log initialized**
Evidence: Change Log section exists (lines 79-82).
