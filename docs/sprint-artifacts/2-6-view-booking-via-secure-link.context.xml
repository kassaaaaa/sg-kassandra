    <iWant>to view my booking details via a secure, unique link</iWant>
    <soThat>I can easily access my lesson information without needing to log in</soThat>
    <tasks>
- [ ] Implement the `app/(auth)/booking/[token]` page component (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Fetch booking details using the provided token
  - [ ] Display booking information (e.g., date, time, instructor, location, status)
- [ ] Implement responsive styling and UX (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Apply responsive styling as per UX Design Specification
  - [ ] Verify layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- [ ] Implement token validation logic in a Supabase Edge Function or API route (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Verify token authenticity and expiration
  - [ ] Ensure token grants access only to the associated booking
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid access (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Handle invalid/expired tokens gracefully (e.g., redirect to unauthorized page)
  - [ ] Display appropriate error messages to the user
- [ ] Integrate the secure link generation into the booking confirmation process (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Generate a unique, time-limited token for each booking
  - [ ] Construct the secure booking link
  - [ ] Pass the link to the email/notification service (or log it for now)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests (AC: #2, #5)
  - [ ] Test token generation and validation logic
  - [ ] Test Edge Function/API route response for valid and invalid tokens
- [ ] Write E2E tests for the secure link flow (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Verify the full flow: Booking -> Link Generation -> Access Page
  - [ ] Verify access with invalid token is blocked
</tasks>

  <acceptanceCriteria>
### Core Functional Requirements
1.  The system shall provide an endpoint `app/(auth)/booking/[token]` that renders specific booking details.
2.  The system shall validate the provided `token` to ensure secure access to only the corresponding booking.
3.  A secure, unique link to this endpoint shall be included in the booking confirmation email (initially mocked or logged if email service is not fully integrated).

### Additional Quality Criteria (Derived from NFRs)
4.  The booking details displayed shall be clear, concise, and responsive on various devices, adhering to UX design principles (Derived from NFR02 Usability).
5.  Access attempts with an invalid or expired token shall result in an appropriate error or redirection (Derived from NFR03 Security).

        <snippet>Story 2.6: Secure Link
1. Endpoint `(auth)/booking/[token]` renders booking details.
2. Token validation ensures access only to that specific booking.
3. Link is included in confirmation email (mock/log if Email service not ready).
The `bookings` table will include `booking_reference` and potentially `weather_snapshot`.</snippet>
