Evidence: Entire document structure.

## Failed Items
(None)

## Partial Items
- **Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention):** Acceptance criteria are present and well-defined, but without the original story draft, an exact match cannot be confirmed.
    Impact: Potential for misalignment between the story as initially conceived and the detailed acceptance criteria.
- **Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets:** Only 3 documents are included. The recommended range is 5-15.
    Impact: Developers might lack sufficient external context or detailed design references.
- **Relevant code references included with reason and line hints:** Line hints are missing from code references.
    Impact: Developers may spend more time locating the exact relevant code sections, reducing efficiency.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: (None)
2. Should Improve: Provide the original story draft or a clear reference to it to enable exact verification of acceptance criteria.
3. Should Improve: Increase the number of relevant documents to within the recommended range of 5-15 to provide more comprehensive context.
4. Should Improve: Add specific line hints (line numbers) to the code references to guide developers more precisely to the relevant code sections.
